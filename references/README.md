## TO DO

LIVE SERVER
On Load - main/index.html? Or move index.html out of folder?

MAIN
Tablet/Mobile - While in tablet/mobile view, click the hamburger icon. The display looks columnar, and instead should be the mimo icon on the left, search bar in the middle, and the hamburger icon on the right, which operates the same as the sort/filter text would in the desktop view.

On search, some of the ratings appear as "0.0". Update these to show as "N/A"
Low priority: the odd time, a search result will return without an image. These can be skipped over.

DETAILS
Search - Page not populating when using the non-main API.
Trailers - Audio continues when video tab is closed.
Trailers - Full screen not operational - should we have the trailer screen be larger to compensate?

OPTIONAL
Additional Filters
Sign-in/Create account page

FINAL
Remove comments (*KEEP TITLES*)
Run code through a validator
